# cupido-backend
Contains the entire backend codebase of Cupido

Since we are no more working on this idea, Hence I made this codebase open so that other people can leverage this. 

We followed **MERN** stack to build this social commerce product. Here's the brief description about Cupido.

**Same Product. Less Money. Simple Enough.**

“Cupido” which means ‘desire’ in french is born out of a problem which we faced while growing up. Being from middle class families, we could never access and afford high quality products. As we lived through different phases of life, we realized we are not the only ones. There are hundreds of millions of Indians who can’t access and afford better stuff. Hence we have created Cupido - a fully community-driven commerce platform where you can buy the things you want together with like-minded people for less.
